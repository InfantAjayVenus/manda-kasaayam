# TODO: README vs Implementation Discrepancies

## Unimplemented Features from docs/README.en.md

These are behaviors described in the README but not yet implemented in the code. Prioritize based on user requirements.

1. **Carrying Completed Tasks (Potential Mismatch)**
   - Description: The README example shows completed tasks (`- [x]`) being carried alongside incomplete ones for historical context.
   - Status: Not required. Only incomplete tasks are required to be carried.
   - Action: Update the README example.

## Notes

- Other features (daily notes, organization, timestamps, TUI, preview, git) are fully implemented and aligned.
- Review and update the README example if these features are not needed.
